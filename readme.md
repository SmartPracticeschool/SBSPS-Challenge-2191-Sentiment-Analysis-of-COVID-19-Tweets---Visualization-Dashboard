Sentiment Analysis of COVID-19 Tweets

In this pandemic, people sitting at home there's no limit for them to tweet any number of tweets.

nowadays hashtag came to rescue of such people. use hundreds of hashtag and reach many people. who are there to verify. if it comes to the analysing sentiments again we don't know, what made him tweet that. so analysing sentiment of a tweet becomes major task.

we will be dealing with the machine learning techniques to handle this sentimental analysis
Bi-LSTM
Convolutional Neural Network
if we could analyse the sentiment it would be helpful for million without being believing blindly. so we can understand the importance of sentimental analysis.
Bi-LSTM and CNN are two efficient techniques to deal with it.
